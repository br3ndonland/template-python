- **Ensure PRs pass all CI checks.**
- **Maintain test coverage at 100%.**

## Git

- _[Why use Git?](https://www.git-scm.com/about)_ Git enables creation of multiple versions of a code repository called branches, with the ability to track and undo changes in detail.
- Install Git by [downloading](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) from the website, or with a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
- [Configure Git to connect to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo.
- Create a [branch](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) in your fork.
- Commit your changes with a [properly-formatted Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Create a [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to incorporate your changes into the upstream project you forked.

## Python

### Hatch

This project uses [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) for dependency management and packaging.

#### Highlights

- **Automatic virtual environment management**: [Hatch automatically manages the application environment](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/environment/).
- **Dependency resolution**: Hatch will automatically resolve any dependency version conflicts using the [`pip` dependency resolver](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/dependency-resolution/).
- **Dependency separation**: [Hatch supports separate lists of optional dependencies in the _pyproject.toml_](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/dependency/). Production installs can skip optional dependencies for speed.
- **Builds**: [Hatch has features for easily building the project into a Python package](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/build/) and [publishing the package to PyPI](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/publish/).

#### Installation

[Hatch can be installed with Homebrew or `pipx`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/).

**Install project with all dependencies: `hatch env create`**.

#### Key commands

```sh
# Basic usage: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/cli/reference/
hatch env create  # create virtual environment and install dependencies
hatch env find  # show path to virtual environment
hatch env show  # show info about available virtual environments
hatch run COMMAND  # run a command within the virtual environment
hatch shell  # activate the virtual environment, like source venv/bin/activate
hatch version  # list or update version of this package
export HATCH_ENV_TYPE_VIRTUAL_PATH=.venv  # install virtualenvs into .venv
```

### Testing with pytest

- Tests are in the _tests/_ directory.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) features used include:
  - [capturing `stdout` with `capfd`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/capture-stdout-stderr.html)
  - [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html)
  - [monkeypatch](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/monkeypatch.html)
  - [parametrize](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/parametrize.html)
  - [temporary directories and files (`tmp_path` and `tmp_dir`)](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/tmpdir.html)
- [pytest plugins](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/plugins.html) include:
  - [pytest-mock](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock)
- [pytest configuration](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html) is in _pyproject.toml_.
- Run tests with pytest and [coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) with `hatch run coverage run`.
- Test coverage reports are generated by [coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy). To generate test coverage reports:
  1. Run tests with `hatch run coverage run`
  2. Generate a report with `coverage report`. To see interactive HTML coverage reports, run `coverage html` instead of `coverage report`.

## Code quality

### Running code quality checks

Code quality checks can be run using the Hatch scripts in _pyproject.toml_.

- Check: `hatch run check`
- Format: `hatch run format`

### Code style

- Python code is formatted with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/). Ruff configuration is stored in _pyproject.toml_.
- Other web code (JSON, Markdown, YAML) is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

### Static type checking

- To learn type annotation basics, see the [Python typing module docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), [Python type annotations how-to](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html), the [Real Python type checking tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/), and [this gist](https://gist.github.com/987bdc6263217895d4bf03d0a5ff114c).
- Type annotations are not used at runtime. The standard library `typing` module includes a `TYPE_CHECKING` constant that is `False` at runtime, but `True` when conducting static type checking prior to runtime. Type imports are included under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` conditions so that they are not imported at runtime. These conditions are ignored when calculating test coverage.
- Type annotations can be provided inline or in separate stub files. Much of the Python standard library is annotated with stubs. For example, the Python standard library [`logging.config` module uses type stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/stdlib/logging/config.pyi). The typeshed types for the `logging.config` module are used solely for type-checking usage of the `logging.config` module itself. They cannot be imported and used to type annotate other modules.
- [basedpyright](https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/) is used for type-checking. See the [basedpyright docs for a comparison with mypy](https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/usage/mypy-comparison/), the type checker used in this project previously. The basedpyright [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=detachhead.basedpyright)/[VSCodium](https://open-vsx.org/extension/detachhead/basedpyright) extension provides a Python language server.

### Spell check

Spell check is performed with [CSpell](https://cspell.org/). The CSpell command is included in the Hatch script for code quality checks (`hatch run check`).

## GitHub Actions workflows

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) service that runs on GitHub repos. It replaces other services like Travis CI. Actions are grouped into workflows and stored in _.github/workflows_. See [Getting the Gist of GitHub Actions](https://gist.github.com/br3ndonland/f9c753eb27381f97336aa21b8d932be6) for more info.

## Maintainers

- **PRs should be merged into the default branch.** Head branches are deleted automatically after PRs are merged.
- **Branch protection is enabled.**
  - Require signed commits
  - Include administrators
  - Do not allow force pushes
  - Require status checks to pass before merging
- **To create a release:**
  - Bump the version number in `__version__` with `hatch version` and commit the changes.
    - Follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) guidelines when choosing a version number. Note that [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) Python version specifiers and SemVer version specifiers differ, particularly with regard to specifying prereleases. Use syntax compatible with both.
    - The PEP 440 default (like `1.0.0a0`) is different from SemVer. Hatch and PyPI will use this syntax by default.
    - An alternative form of the Python prerelease syntax permitted in PEP 440 (like `1.0.0-alpha.0`) is compatible with SemVer, and this form should be used when tagging releases. As Hatch uses PEP 440 syntax by default, prerelease versions need to be written directly into `__version__`.
    - Examples of acceptable tag names: `1.0.0`, `1.0.0-alpha.0`, `1.0.0-beta.1`
  - Push the version bump and verify all CI checks pass.
  - Create an [annotated and signed Git tag](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).
    - List PRs and commits in the tag message:
      ```sh
      git log --pretty=format:"- %s (%h)" \
        "$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)"..HEAD
      ```
    - Omit the leading `v` (use `1.0.0` instead of `v1.0.0`)
    - Example: `git tag -a -s 1.0.0`
  - Push the tag. GitHub Actions will build and publish the Python package.
- Consider [keeping a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). There are many tools and approaches for this. Most of them work like this:
  1. Accumulate "fragments" as the project is developed. These could be text files in a directory under version control, or could also be Git commit/PR/tag messages. Fragments should contain human-readable summaries of code changes.
  2. Collect the fragments and combine them into a text file like CHANGELOG.md.
